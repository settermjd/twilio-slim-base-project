# Twilio / Slim Base Project

This is a small, almost skeleton project that I base my PHP projects on which underpin [my Twilio tutorials][twilio-tutorials].
It's not intended to be special, nor feature-rich.
Rather, it's designed to save me time getting started building my next PHP project for an upcoming Twilio tutorial.

It:

- Is a small, web-based PHP application based on [the Slim Framework][slim-framework]
- Has one route which returns no body, and a minimum of HTTP headers
- Wraps Slim's `Application` object in a small utility class to make writing maintainable code easier

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following to use the application:

- PHP 8.4 or above
- [Composer][composer] installed globally
- Your preferred code editor or IDE
- Some terminal experience is helpful, though not required

## Quick Start

To create a new project from this project, wherever you store your PHP apps, run the following command:

```bash
composer create-project settermjd/twilio-slim-base-project my-project
```

Then, open [the Twilio Console][twilio-console] in your browser of choice, and copy the **Account SID**, **Auth Token**, and **phone number** from the **Account Info**, as you can see in the screenshot below.

![The Twilio Console's Account Info panel, with the Account SID and My Twilio phone number field's redacted.](./docs/images/twilio-console-account-info-panel-shorter.png)

Then, set those values as the values of `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, respectively, in _.env_.
